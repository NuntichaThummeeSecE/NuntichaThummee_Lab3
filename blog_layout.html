        <h3>Who is Laufey? The genre-defying singer-songwriter bringing classical and jazz to Gen Z</h3>
        <p> Laufey Lín Bing Jónsdóttir, known as Laufey (pronounced ‘lay-vay’), is an Icelandic singer-songwriter,
            record
            producer and multi-instrumentalist, who is taking the music world by storm.
            Active since the early 2020s, she has achieved prominence for her success as a jazz and classical-inspired
            pop artist. This year, the 25-year-old won her first Grammy for her 2023 album, Bewitched, taking home the
            Best Traditional Pop Album award.Having performed as a cello soloist with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra at
            age 15, Laufey was a finalist in
            the 2014 edition of Iceland’s Got Talent and a semi-finalist on The Voice Iceland the following year.
            Laufey was born in 1999 in Reykjavík. Her father is Icelandic father and her mother Chinese. Laufey credits
            her family for inspiring a love of music – her mother is a classical violinist, and her grandfather was a
            violin teacher at the Central Conservatory of Music in China.</p>
